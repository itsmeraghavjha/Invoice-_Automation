#         2. IGNORE anything handwritten, stamped, or annotated on the document — 
#         regardless of where it appears (top, corners, margins, body). These are 
#         internal notes added by the recipient, not the vendor's invoice number.
#         3. The correct invoice number is always printed by the vendor inside a 
#         structured label/table/box on the document.
#         4. DO NOT extract GSTIN (15 chars), PAN (10 chars), PO numbers, GRN numbers, 
#         or any stamp/seal text.
#         5. May contain slashes (/), hyphens (-), or financial year indicators (e.g. 25-26).

#         CRITICAL RULES FOR 'po_numbers':
#         1. SAP PO numbers must be exactly 10 digits, in range 3300000000 to 8259999999.

#         "Buyer's Order No.", "PO Number", "Reference No.", or "Our Order No."
#         3. STRICTLY IGNORE any number that is handwritten, stamped, annotated, 
#         or added in pen/pencil anywhere on the document — even if it falls within 
#         the valid 10-digit range. Handwritten additions are internal recipient notes, 
#         never vendor-issued PO references.
#         4. A valid PO is ONLY one that is machine-printed by the vendor inside a 
#         structured field or table cell.
#         5. DO NOT extract Sales Orders (prefixed with SO/DISSO) or any number outside 
#         the valid range or not exactly 10 digits.

#         that appear above the numbered rows inside the description column — these are 
#         structural labels, not line items.
#         3. A description cell may span multiple lines — concatenate all lines belonging 
#         to that cell into a single space-separated string.
#         4. EXCLUDE any lines within the cell that are metadata key-value pairs, 
#         identifiable by a label followed by a colon (e.g. "Lot Number:", 
#         "Net Unit Wt:", "Batch No:", "Expiry Date:").
